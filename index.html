    <H1>Welcome to Smuud candles</H1>
    <h2 style="color:blueviolet ;" >handpoured soy candles</h2>
     <hr>
     <p>Hello, How are you all? Honestly It feels so amazing to see
        you on this page, I know this is looking simple website,
        but good part about this website is I have created it on my own üòÖ.
     </p>

     <h3>Little about soy candles</h3>
     <img src="./Photo/DSC04867.JPG" height="300px" alt="Soy candle wax">
     <p>This entire website is only about soy wax candles which I make
        at home using all natural ingredients, I hate using artificial substances.
        because at the end I also have to deal with those artificial things and honestly I really care about
        my health, and so do I about you. And one of my basic policy about my product is 
        whatever quality I am using, I'd really like to present same quality 
        to the customers also. Most of us we don't care about quality 
        because of money but believe me forget about money always prioritise your health first
        because its about our health and future generation.
     </p>

<h3>about quality</h3>
     <p>Wait, Now you will get the clear picture of everything, just go on the Google and
        search for a word "Phthalate" and read it. That is what exactly an artificial substances
        most of companies add to increase their product shelf life. Honestly I am not 
        much into science and all but till now whatever I learnt from google 
        this what short summary i can show it to you, rest you are more intellegent and smarter than me.

     </p>

     <h4>oops I think i have written so much, you must be bored I know, I hate to bore people.</h4>

     <H3>Ingredients:</H3>
     <p>Natural Soy Wax & Phtalate free Fragrance Oil...... Yes that's it.</p>

     <p>I know the ingredientslooks so simple but when it comes to
        make a perfect candle you need to experiment a lot and it takes 
        time to make a proper candle, you need patience also. Ohh wait I forgot to 
        mention "Patience" in the ingredients part.
